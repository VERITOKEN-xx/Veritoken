/**
 * Veritoken Structured Event Types
 *
 * All Veritoken contracts emit events via Soroban's event system.
 * Each event has a topic tuple (first element is always the event name Symbol)
 * and a data payload.
 *
 * Use Stellar RPC `getEvents` with a `ContractId` filter and a topic[0] filter
 * to subscribe to specific event types.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const events = await server.getEvents({
 *   startLedger: fromLedger,
 *   filters: [{
 *     type: "contract",
 *     contractIds: [rwaTokenContractId],
 *     topics: [[TOPIC_TRANSFER]], // base64-encoded Symbol XDR
 *   }],
 * });
 * ```
 */

// ── Topic name constants ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// These match the Soroban Symbol values emitted by the contracts.
